Red roses aren't the only flower with a romantic meaning, so you don't have to totally splurge to show your 

dedication. Red tulips are also considered a declaration of love, and they're especially gorgeous in the 

spring.</font></p>

		<p align = "left" ><font size = "6" face="arial"> Red tulips are the hue of choice to express 

that you are deeply in love. The color red evokes passion and romance. Tulips are the flower associated with 

the 11th wedding anniversary, as well. If you have a decade plus one year together, or if you just want to 

let her know you want to be with her that long and more, red tulips are a great choice. </font></p>
